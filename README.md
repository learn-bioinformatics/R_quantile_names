# R_quantile_names

This will eventually be an R package, but for now source it within your R script:

    source("R_quantile_names.R")

    print(quantile_names(c(1:29), n = 7))
    
     [1]  "1st" "1st" "1st" "1st" "2nd" "2nd" "2nd" "2nd" "3rd" "3rd" "3rd"
     [12] "3rd" "4th" "4th" "4th" "4th" "5th" "5th" "5th" "5th" "6th" "6th"
     [23] "6th" "6th" "7th" "7th" "7th" "7th" "7th"
